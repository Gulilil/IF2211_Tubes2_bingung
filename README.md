## **Program Description**
This program is a treasure-collect and maze-solver program. The maze used by the program will be inputted from a .txt file. Therefore, users can custom the maze by their own willing. After reading section, the contents inside the .txt file will be converted into a matrix. There are several objects inside the maze itself, which are walls, routes, and treasures. The goal of the program is to find a route, from a starting coordinate, to collect all the treasures within the maze. This problem will be solved using BFS (*Breadth-First-Search*) and DFS (*Depth-First-Search*) algorithm. The output of the program is a GUI (*graphical user interface*) to display the solution of the given problems.
